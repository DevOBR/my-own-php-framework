# My Own PHP Framework

My Own PHP Framework is a lightweight PHP framework that I have created for developers who want to start a new project from scratch using the MVC (Model-View-Controller) design pattern. This framework provides a basic structure and essential components to kickstart your project without the need to set up everything from scratch.

## Key Features

- **MVC Design Pattern:** The framework follows the MVC design pattern, which separates the application into three interconnected components: Model, View, and Controller. This promotes code organization and maintainability.

- **Easy to Get Started:** To begin using the framework, simply download the project and start adding your controllers, views, and models following the framework's conventions.

- **Modular Architecture:** The framework's modular architecture allows you to add or remove components as needed, providing flexibility in the development process.

- **Clean and Minimalistic:** My Own PHP Framework is intentionally kept simple and minimalistic, making it easy for developers of all levels to understand and customize.

## How to Use

1. Clone or download the repository.

2. Set up your local development environment with a PHP server.

3. Start building your application by adding your controllers, views, and models to the appropriate directories:

   - Controllers: Add your PHP controller files in the `controllers` directory.
   - Views: Create your HTML/PHP view files in the `views` directory.
   - Models: Define your data models in the `models` directory.

4. Define routes in the `routes.php` file to map URLs to specific controllers and actions.

5. Run your PHP server, and you're ready to start testing your application.
